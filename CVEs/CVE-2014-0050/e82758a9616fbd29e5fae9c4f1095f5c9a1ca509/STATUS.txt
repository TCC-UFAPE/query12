MIGRATE XWORK NOW (see "[Struts Tt] Xwork?")

MIGRATING FROM ACTION 1 TO ACTION 2 

An area on the wiki is devoted to migrating from Action 1 to Action 2 

* http://wiki.apache.org/struts/StrutsAction2

There is an Apps area in the sandbox for new Action2 code, starting with 
example applications.

* https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/sandbox/trunk/action2/

** The MailReader application has been ported. Comments and fixes 
welcome. The "Tour" is next.

** A new Cookbook application has been started. The suggestion is 
that we combine the WW Showcase examples and the various Struts 
Examples into a unified cookbook. The cookbook application can 
display the code used to create the "recipes", like the Tomcat 
Example application.

** The design of the cookbook makes it easy to add new recipes. 
Please feel free to jump in and contribute!

PACKAGE NAMING

* org.opensyphony -> org.apache.struts
* webwork -> action2

* tag prefix: saf
* property and configuration files: action

--

* The Dojo component package was previously 'webwork'.  
** It is temporarily renamed it to 'struts', but that might conflict 
   with Shale if they create new Dojo components.
*** Or perhaps that might be a good thing?

<< Ted: I'd say rename this component to "action". Apache Struts is 
   the *project* name, like "Open Symphony", not the *product* name, 
   like XWork or Sitemesh. If we name anything new "Struts", 
   it should be because it's something that is being used by multiple 
   Apache Struts products.

WORKING ACTION2 BUILD 

* The WebWork2 Incubator code now builds struts-action-2.0-dev.jar

** This JAR can be placed into your sandboxes for runtime testing

* The initial renaming is complete,and the repository seems stable 
enough to make further changes.  

* The WebWork 2 project had a continuous integration server for automated
builds and testing.It would be valuable to have that service, even while 
in the Incubator. 

** What about setting up a temporary build server either in an 
Apache zone or on a developer's computer?

WIKI DOCUMENTATION

What do we need to do to register the Snippet macro the ASF SVN?

* http://forums.opensymphony.com/thread.jspa?threadID=24290&tstart=0

For an ongoing Confluence instance, worse case, there's another 
Confluence installation that we can use, hosted by Contegrix.

* http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/oss/dashboard.action

But,Jeff Turner may be working on getting us a Confluence instance on an ASF machine.
